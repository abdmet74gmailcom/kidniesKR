✅ My Strong Recommendation (Best for CNN)
✅ Option 1 — Mendeley Weather Dataset (BEST START)
📌 Link:

Why I advise it:

✅ Already structured as image folders
✅ Perfect size (not too small, not too huge)
✅ Used in many CNN research papers
✅ Contains Rain class directly
✅ Very easy to convert into:

Rain

NoRain (Cloudy + Shine + Sunrise)
